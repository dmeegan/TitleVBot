# Title V Bot

Title V Bot is a web application to help you design septic systems in accordance with the Massachusetts Title V("Title-Five") regulations [310 CMR 15.000](https://www.mass.gov/doc/310-cmr-15000-title-5-of-the-state-environmental-code/download). See the demo and overview below!

## Overview

The Title V Bot application guides the user through the necessary design procedure for a typical septic system. Built in alerts serve the purpose of notifying the user of any inputs that may be against the regulations. Having built in edge cases make the application a good tool for teaching someone who may not be too familiar with the regulations.

The program is built in such a way that many options and calculations are dependent on previous user inputs and selections. For instance, per the Title V regulations a percolation rate of 20 inches per hour can only be either Soil Class II or Soil Class III. Therefore, when a user inputs a 20 in/hr percolation rate, the Soil Class options for Class I and IV are automatically disabled.
